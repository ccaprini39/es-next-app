This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

right now this runs in http at localhost 3000
the db is located at localhost 8090
the user is example@test.com
the password is PasswordPassword

The purpose of this application is to conduct tests on elasticsearch instances

I know that I need to configure it to allow unsigned certs because elasticsearch is running with self signed certs at https://localhost:9200

The username and password are:
